## Project Description:
My project aims to address the challenge of accurately tracking employee attendance by incorporating a Proof of Work document system.

Key Features:

User-Friendly Interface: The DApp will provide a user-friendly and very cool interface for employees to record their attendance.

Wallet Binding: The DApp will require employees to bind their attendance records with their unique wallets. This ensures that only the authorized individual associated with the wallet can record their attendance, preventing proxy attendance or fraudulent check-ins.

Integration with UMA's Optimistic Oracle: We will integrate UMA's Optimistic Oracle to enable the verification of alignment between attendance records and the associated Proof of Work documents for each employee. In case of any discrepancies between the recorded attendance and the submitted work proof, individuals will have the ability to initiate disputes. These disputes will undergo a voting process for resolution, ensuring that successful disputes are approved through a voting consensus mechanism. This integration ensures the accurate matching of attendance records and work proof, enhancing the overall credibility of the system.

Utilization of block.timestamp: The DApp will utilize the block.timestamp value, which represents the timestamp of the current block on the Ethereum blockchain, for recording the clock-in and clock-out times of employees. This timestamp is secure and resistant to tampering, as it is generated by the blockchain network itself.

Selection of High-Speed Blockchain Networks: The timestamp recording smart contract will be deployed on blockchain networks specifically designed for fast block generation, such as Mantle and Scroll chains. These networks have shorter block times, reducing the intervals between blocks and enabling more precise recording of attendance times.

By utilizing a Proof of Work document system and integrating UMA's Optimistic Oracle, our attendance tracking DApp aims to provide a reliable and verifiable solution for accurately recording and validating employee attendance. It allows employees to submit relevant evidence to support their work activities, ensuring transparency and accountability within the attendance management process.


## How it's Made

The core contract of the project is implemented in Solidity, using Foundry as the development framework. Foundry provides tools for contract compilation, deployment, and unit testing.

To validate attendance status, the project utilizes UMA's Optimistic Oracle V3. ApeCoin is used as the bond.

Layerzero is employed for cross-chain interaction.

The contracts are deployed on the Mantle and Scroll and Goerli test networks.

The frontend is built using Next.js, a React framework. React enables component-driven UI development.

Moralis and Web3UIKit support blockchain interactions such as wallet connectivity and contract calls.

Tailwind CSS is used for styling and layout.

Fleek is used as the deployment tool for the website.
